# line_based_event_camera_calib


## Introduction

This repository contains the key code of our line-based event camera calibration algorithms.

Details of the algorithm can be found in our paper:

"LECalib: Line-based Event Camera Calibration"



## Main Function


Simulation test of random data can be found in 

```
demo.m: algorithm testing
noise_test_both.m     : accuracy w.r.t varying image noise
linenumber_test_both.m: accuracy w.r.t varying number of lines
f_test_both.m         : accuracy w.r.t varying focal length
w_test_both.m         : accuracy w.r.t varying measurement error of angular and linear velocities

```
